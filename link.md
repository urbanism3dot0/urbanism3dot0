Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to crypto-economic organisms â€” decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. Urbanism 3.0 pairs a virtual, online cyberspace with the physical world, the urban environment. The pair is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>

In its final form, the shared state is a metaverse populated by avatar representations of real people and is specifically designed to enable interactions from the cyber world to our physical urban and architectural environment. Interactions among people, avatars and software bots create a new era of cyber-urban life [insert] in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules<br><br>

Ultimately Urbanism 3.0 create alternative models and methods for how societies should design and develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens.
To do this Urbanism 3.0 creates a decentralized porgrammable framework for creating pairs of cyber physical assets that are programmable and can be assemblied like lego bricks to create higher order structures. The applications we can create using these  components include: 
* Autonomous self-organizing growth and spatial configuration systems combined with top down planning and zoning
* and Public-community partnerships.
to enable Joint development of cities providing communities with more powerful ways of building cities collectively and entering into public-community contracts using their money. This includes creating and managing special crypto-economic zones, sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts
* The "Hybrid Pair" protocol make possible a model of common resources ecosystems, where citizens, both individually and collectively own, govern, and make the most of their common resources. The interoperability between realities and systemsis achieved with a mechanism specifically designed to connect any type of common resource, organization or property right to a digital asset creating a "hybrid-pair". The digital representation on-chain of physical assets and property rights, is verified by access to real-world data and off-chain computation<br>
* Decentralized Cooperative structures 
* Governance through Autonomous Markets
A Pair can be traded with decentralized Autonomous Market Maker enabling novel forms of assets and governance of the commons
*  with Real-Time Risk managment 
* Solving The incentives problem Climate Change 
This would also enable novel form of incentives structures that would help solve the climate change problem if combined with inventive engineering.

## The Institute
We are introducing a decentralized institute to help bridge the technologies and ecosystem of web3 with the field of Urbanism and to help form Urbanism 3.0 as an area of study and applied research. The purpose of the institute is to use Urbanism 3.0 to create more and better cities faster and harness the power of urbanization to bring up to the world standard entire regions.<br>

## The Collective
The urbanism 3.0 collective: an experiment to enable decentralised participation  of people to jointly contribute to the development of an Institution backed by fractional ownership of the institution itself, thus providing a way to align incentives and share the benefits of future outcomes.<br>
We identify opportunity in:
Public-Community partnerships in Crypto Economic Zones. There is an opportunity for a decentralized cooperative to champion the production of the first collectively-owned Autonomous City, and create a new era for cities. The Institute aims to become a...



## The experiment
Designing Web3 Futures to Change the World
The idea that Web3 tech can form the foundational layer to imagine and prototype complex socio-economic and political systems of the future, has the potential to change the world.  Web3 also provides the technology stack and tools for realizing these worlds.  If web3 can demonstrate a brighter future and maps the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome and that will create a movement that will benefit humanity and the planet.<br>

This transformational power remains unused because it is too complex and daunting for any small team or organization to tackle alone. In this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design radical new solutions that disrupt conventional thinking and that inform a rich and unexpected world without deep collaboration between multiple stakeholders of all types including communities and local governance.<br>

Because of the barrier to entry into complex fields in real life, the development of Web3 applications is being kept inside the internet bubble. Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade.<br>


We are introducing a collective experiment to unlock the potential of communities to use web3 technologies [to offer solutions on global problems.] to change the world. The idea that web3 can inform the design of a better tomorrow is a powerful one. Web3 represents a chance to reimagine our collective future and rebuild [our relation to the planet] on first principles. <br>
What Web3 offers is a unique system to imagine and prototype complex socio-economic and political systems of the future,  and the tools for realizing these worlds. <br>
#### This transformational potential of web3 is blocked because:
* There are no visions associated with web3 technologies and a clear pathway to arrive there is lacking. <br>
* There is a lack of technical understanding and comprehensive documentation, which makes it very difficult for non-technical users (such as myself) to understand the technologies. The Web3 community needs to reach out to a non-technical audience to increase the adoption of the technologies.

* Lack of developing context. Web3 is being kept inside the internet bubble. Developers are working inside a vacuum because of the lack of context.
Innovations vs radical ideas
* The biggest barrier to widespread adoption is the lack of accessible, useful, and meaningful applications that sit on top of web3.






## !
The Institute starts as a collective loosely organized on the Ethereum network as a community with a membership token in common and nothing more than a mutual understanding where we want to go.<br>
